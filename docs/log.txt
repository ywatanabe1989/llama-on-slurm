User: what is the recipe of mayonnaise?

> Assistant: The classic condiment! Mayonnaise is a simple yet versatile sauce made from just a few ingredients. Here's the basic recipe:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 large egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar (such as white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (240 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola, grapeseed, or light olive oil

**Instructions:**

1. **In a medium bowl**, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar, and salt until well combined.
2. **Slowly pour the oil**: While continuously whisking the egg yolk mixture, slowly pour the oil into the bowl in a thin, steady stream. Start with a very slow pour, as the mixture will thicken quickly.
3. **Whisk constantly**: Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies, which should take about 5-7 minutes. You'll know it's working when the mixture starts to turn into a smooth, creamy sauce.
4. **Taste and adjust**: Once the mayonnaise has thickened, taste it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more lemon juice, salt, or even a pinch of sugar to taste.
5. **Store in the fridge**: Transfer the mayonnaise to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

**Tips and Variations:**

* **Use room temperature ingredients**: This will help the mayonnaise come together more smoothly.
* **Don't over-whisk**: Stop whisking once the mayonnaise has thickened, as over-whisking can cause it to break.
* **Add flavorings**: Consider adding minced garlic, grated ginger, or chopped herbs like parsley or dill to create different flavor variations.
* **Make it lighter**: If you prefer a lighter mayonnaise, you can add a little water or buttermilk to thin it out.
* **Try different oils**: While neutral-tasting oils work best, you can experiment with other oils like avocado oil or sesame oil for unique flavor profiles.

**Troubleshooting:**

* **Mayonnaise doesn't thicken**: If the mixture doesn't thicken, it may be due to the oil being poured too quickly or the egg yolks being too cold. Try starting again with a slower pour
